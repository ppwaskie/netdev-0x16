# netdev-0x16
LaTeX scaffolding for my NetDev paper this year

To build, make sure to install the texlive packages on your distro.

Then run:

$ pdflatex pj-netdev-0x16.tex

You may need to run it a second time to get the bibliography sections to
populate correctly (needs a second pass after initial indexing).
